# PFE
 
## Utilisation

Any of the required dependecies for this projet are in this folder and if they are not it is that any modification to them was not necessary.
From a freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04:

So make sure to check if there is a version of what you are looking for in this folder before copying from otherwhere.[Warn] there might be still some issues currently as it has not been completely tested

```bash
make install_all
```

Afterward use one of the `launch` function in the Makefile to see the result. Example:

```bash
make launch_example
```
